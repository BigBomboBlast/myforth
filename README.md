# MYFORTH

I wanted to create my own custom programming language from scratch. I think something like Forth would be very easy to implement, and I also am following [Tsoding's Porth Streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QP2fDBIxjM&list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VbMZA7wW9aR3EtBqe2kinu4&index=1) for inspiration. Note that I have no idea what i'm doing as I have been coding in Rust for about a week and don't even really know how Forth works. Ah well, all is in good fun!

## STATE OF PROJECT RN

There is a basic REPL that will read commands and print the stack as well as how the program is being tokenized.

You can do conditional branching with if-else statements, and while loops work as well. You can now have floats, integers, and characters onto the stack. You are also given 1kb of memory to read and write to, and can do pointer arithmetic and stuff. 

## TODO

This is extreme work in progress and these are my plans:

- Implement some kind of procedures/functions
- Make string literals work
- Add comments
- Add more instructions

## Thats literally it

I don't want to set the scope too big. This is literally just supposed to be a interpreter. I definetly want to finish it though and have it be a useable programming language that way I can be like "Hey check out this thing I made with my CUSTOM PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE" and everyone will be like "ooooooh"
