# MYFORTH

I wanted to create my own custom programming language from scratch. I think something like Forth would be very easy to implement, and I also am following [Tsoding's Porth Streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QP2fDBIxjM&list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VbMZA7wW9aR3EtBqe2kinu4&index=1) for inspiration. Note that I have no idea what i'm doing as I have been coding in Rust for about a week and don't even really know how Forth works. Ah well, all is in good fun!

## STATE OF PROJECT RN

at this point, the project is almost complete. I knew once you where able to define your own procedures that My Forth implementation would be complete, since then language would become useable. Now I just gotta clean up the error messaging, add comments, run some tests, then use the langauge myself to write some basic programs/algorithms. 

## TODO

- clean up error messaging
- add comments
- run some tests
- write a fizzbuzz program and some other crap so that I can prove to myself that my language is useable.
- add some actual documentation

## Thats literally it

I don't want to set the scope too big. This is literally just supposed to be a interpreter. I definetly want to finish it though and have it be a useable programming language that way I can be like "Hey check out this thing I made with my CUSTOM PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE" and everyone will be like "ooooooh"
